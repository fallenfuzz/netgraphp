This is a php script which uses LLDP information to traverse SNMP servers in a
network and produce a graphical map of different hosts and connections in the
network. The graph is produced with the graphviz dot syntax and graphviz can
be used to produce different file formats like .png or .eps. All connections
to be identified must have LLDP support at both ends and SNMP support at least
at one end. Most high end switches have built in support for SNMP and LLDP.
Computer hosts need something like lldpd together with an SNMP server and the
SNMP server need to provide the .1.0.8802.1.1.2.1 LLDP information.

Usage examples
==============

netgraphp -h
shows some help

netgraphp some.host.in.my.net > /tmp/my_net.dot
Creates a graphviz dot file.

netgraphp -c my_secret_snmp_community -d some.host.in.net > /tmp/net.dot
Uses a custom SNMP community to traverse your network.

netgraphp my_switch.net | dot -Tpng -o /tmp/my_net.png
Uses graphviz dot to create a png file. The network topology will probably look
best if you give switches as commands on the command line.

netgraphp -d switch1.net switch2.net | dot -Tpdf -o /tmp/my_net.pdf
Strips domain name from host names and uses graphviz dot to create a .pdf file.

netgraphp -t 2000000 my_switch.net | dot -Teps -o /tmp/my_net.eps
Increases SNMP timeout to 2s for a slow network and uses dot to create eps.

Dependencies
============
PHP compiled with SNMP support
Graphviz
Network devices with LLDP and SNMP

Installation
============

1) Adjust path to php
As netgraphp is a php script no compilation is necessary. However, to run
netgraphp you will need php installed and might have to modify the first
row of the file netgraphp to make that row point to your php binary.
The line that you might have to edit looks like this:
#!/usr/bin/php

2) Copy directory structure
The entire directory structure should be copied to some location that you
prefer. The important thing is that the filters directory lies next to the
netgraphp file, this README and the COPYING file is not important for
functionality but might be good to keep for reference.

3) Adjust PATH in login file
Unless you want to give the entire path to the netgraphp script like
/my/preferred/path/netgraphp switch1 host2 -c my_community1 -c other_community
add the installation directory to your path. How this is done depends upon your
shell, but if you are an advanced user seeing the use of this tool you probably
also knows how to modify your PATH :-)

FAQ
===

Q: Why can't I see my host X in the generated image?
A: To be shown, both X and the device at the other end of the network cable
   must support LLDP. Also, at least one of the devices need to provide LLDP
   information by SNMP and this SNMP server must have been found as an argument
   to the command line or by traversing other SNMP servers providing SNMP
   information. Traversing of SNMP servers will only be successful if it is
   possible to resolve the SysName provided by LLDP.

Q: Why is one of my devices marked gray in the graph?
A: That device does support LLDP but did not provide any SNMP information, all
   information about that device was provided by its neighbor. This also means
   that other devices beyond that device might be hidden as the SNMP traverse
   stops there.

Q: Why isn't the link speed shown at one of my network connections.
A: Both ends of that network link did provide SNMP information about the link
   speed, but they didn't provide the same speed. As least one of those given
   speeds must be wrong and we don't want to risk presenting any wrong results.
